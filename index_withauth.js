//you will see a lot of .use(); these are not called manually. Instead, they are automatically executed by the Express.js framework when a request is received.  This method is used to mount middleware functions in an Express application. Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. These functions can perform any operations, make changes to the request and the response objects, end the request-response cycle, and call the next middleware function in the stack.

    //storing session is important so that user can remain logged in as they navigate through different pages of the application without having to log in again on each page. preferences as well would stored, cart items would be save, forms input would be save.
